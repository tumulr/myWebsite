Astro is an amazing framework for building fast websites. In this post, I share my experience getting started with Astro and how it compares to other frameworks.

## Why Astro?

Astro is a modern framework designed for building content-focused websites. It allows you to use your favorite UI components (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) but delivers zero JavaScript by default, resulting in extremely fast loading times.

## Key Features

- **Component Islands:** Use UI framework components but only hydrate them when necessary
- **Zero JavaScript by default:** Send only HTML and CSS to the browser
- **Edge-ready:** Deploy anywhere with ease
- **Customizable:** Tailwind, MDX, and hundreds of integrations to choose from

## Getting Started

Starting a new Astro project is simple. You can use the following command:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

This will guide you through the setup process and create a new Astro project with the default template.

## Conclusion

Astro has been a game-changer for my web development workflow. The ability to use components from any UI framework while still delivering lightning-fast websites is unmatched. I highly recommend giving it a try for your next project!
