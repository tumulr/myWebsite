I recently rebuilt my personal website using Astro and React. In this post, I explain my design decisions and the development process.

## Why I Chose Astro

For a personal website that's primarily content-focused, Astro was the perfect choice. It allowed me to deliver a fast experience without sacrificing the developer experience I love.

## Design Philosophy

I wanted a clean, minimalist design that puts the content first. The site uses a simple color scheme with plenty of whitespace to ensure readability.

## Technical Stack

- **Astro:** For the overall site structure and static generation
- **React:** For interactive components where needed
- **CSS:** Custom styling with component-scoped CSS

## Performance Considerations

By using Astro's partial hydration feature, I was able to keep the initial JavaScript payload tiny while still having interactive elements where needed.

## Conclusion

Building this site was a great learning experience. The combination of Astro and React provided the perfect balance of performance and developer experience.
