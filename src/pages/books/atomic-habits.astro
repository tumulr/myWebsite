                <li>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1% better every day counts for a lot in the long run.</li>
                <li>Focus on your identity rather than outcomes. The goal is not to read a book, but to become a reader.</li>

            <h2>The Four Laws of Behavior Change</h2>

            <h3>1. Make it Obvious</h3>
            <p>Be aware of your habits through a habit scorecard. Use implementation intentions ("I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]"). Use habit stacking to build new habits onto existing ones.</p>

            <h3>2. Make it Attractive</h3>
            <p>Use temptation bundling. Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. Create a motivation ritual.</p>

            <h3>3. Make it Easy</h3>
            <p>Reduce friction. Prime your environment for future use. Master the decisive moment. Use the Two-Minute Rule to make habits easy to start.</p>

            <h3>4. Make it Satisfying</h3>
            <p>Use reinforcement. Make "doing nothing" enjoyable. Use a habit tracker. Never miss twice.</p>

            <h2>Advanced Tactics</h2>
            <p>The Goldilocks Rule: humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.</p>
